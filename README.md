[Deployed Link](https://6568bae37ca2ec042a6031bc--unique-griffin-579177.netlify.app/)

A simple HTML project that allows users to perform arithmetic operations on a given initial value. The project provides buttons with different triggers (onclick, ondblclick, onmouseenter, onmouseover, onmouseout) to perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus operations.

## Features

- Enter an initial value in the input box.
- Perform various arithmetic operations using different triggers.
- View the result displayed in the result box.

## How to Use

1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
2. Enter a number in the input box.
3. Click, double-click, mouse enter, mouse over, or mouse out using the respective buttons to perform operations.
4. View the result displayed in the result box.

## Buttons and Operations

- **onclick() +2:** Adds 2 to the input number.
- **ondblClick() -2:** Subtracts 2 from the input number.
- **onmouseenter() *2:** Multiplies the input number by 2 on mouse enter.
- **onmouseover() /2:** Divides the input number by 2 on mouse over.
- **onmouseout() %2:** Finds the modulus of the input number by 2 on mouse out.

## Styling

The project features a clean and responsive design with a centered layout, providing an easy-to-use interface.

## Project Structure

- **index.html**: The main HTML file that defines the structure and functionality of the arithmetic operations.
- **README.md**: The readme file providing information about the project.
